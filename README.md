# Unscented Kalman Filter for Highway Driving

This project implements an Unscented Kalman Filter in C++ and runs it against a simulation of a radar and lidar measurements of from an ego car as it travels down the highway. The animation below shows the ego car in green and the surrounding traffic in blue.
